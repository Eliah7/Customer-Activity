# Customer-Activity

## Introduction
This project entails creating a service for recording user activity when using a website. This data collected can then be used to understand the business more, improve marketing techniques and create personalized experiences for the users.

### Why not use google analytics?
Well, one reason is I don't like the idea of my data going through to google. Another more important reason is google offers generic services some that are general for most businesses, while the truth is each business is unique and has unique data requirements.

## Bottlenecks 
This project requires the implementation of the service to be smooth and offer fast responces to requests that is not slow down the browser.
